TODO for 0.8:
- Add a new logfile algorithm (this to take advantage of perl more than
	it is currently. It will break bashpodder support but make goldenpod
	more reliable)
- Add wget support, only use when curl is not available.

- - -

Suggested (provide feedback on http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/goldenpod
 if you want them to be implemented (submit a wishlist bug)):

- Ability to "quickly download" the first podcast of a feed, like so:
  goldenpod --quick [FEED_URL]
  That will download the first file in [FEED_URL], only write that one to the
  logfile and not check the ones in the configs.
- Convert goldenpod into a perl lib and make gpconf into a complete
  goldenpod GUI.

- - -

Suggested (but perhaps outdated now that we have gpconf?):

- Ability to add podcasts via a commandline option:
  goldenpod --add [feed url]

- Ability to remove podcasts via a commandline option:
  goldenpod --remove [feed url]
