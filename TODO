TODO for 0.9:
- Add a new logfile algorithm (this to take advantage of perl more than
	it is currently. It will break bashpodder support but make goldenpod
	more reliable)

- - -

Suggested (feedback welcome):

- Ability to "quickly download" the first podcast of a feed, like so:
  goldenpod --quick [FEED_URL]
  That will download the first file in [FEED_URL], only write that one to the
  logfile and not check the ones in the configs.
