TODO for 0.8:
- Add a new logfile algorithm (this to take advantage of perl more than
	it is currently. It will break bashpodder support but make goldenpod
	more reliable)
- Ability to add podcasts via a commandline option:
  goldenpod --add [feed url]
- Ability to remove podcasts via a commandline option:
  goldenpod --remove [feed url]
- Ability to list podcasts via a commandline option:
  goldenpod --list

- - -

Suggested (feedback welcome):

- Ability to "quickly download" the first podcast of a feed, like so:
  goldenpod --quick [FEED_URL]
  That will download the first file in [FEED_URL], only write that one to the
  logfile and not check the ones in the configs.
