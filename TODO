TODO for 0.9:
- Handle 304 more gracefully
- Add tests for duplicate downloads (if something has already been downloaded
	as part of another feed, simply skip the download bit and go straight to
	adding it to the logfile)
- Rwrite the logfile system, taking more advantage of perl than currently
	in addition to using the old podcasts.log. Keep track of filenames -> feed
	mappings there to avoid the (arguably extremely rare) case of a file
	getting moved. Use JSON when possible, storable otherwise. Migrate storable
	to JSON if JSON becomes available.
- Add [X/Y] to each line, X being current download, Y being total downloads
