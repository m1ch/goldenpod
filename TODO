TODO for 0.9:
- Rwrite the logfile system, taking more advantage of perl than currently
	instead of using the old podcasts.log. Keep track of filenames -> feed
	mappings there to avoid the (arguably extremely rare) case of a file getting
	moved.
- A --quick command-line option to allow a user to download a single file from
	a feed, without having to add it permanently to goldenpod.
