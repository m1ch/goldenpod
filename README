GoldenPod - a podcast client in perl
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For installation instructions see the INSTALL file.

GoldenPod is a command-line podcast client (or podcast aggregator, or
podcatcher, feel free to pick whichever name you want) written in perl. 

It runs in either of two modes. The primary mode reads from configuration files
in ~/.goldenpod, and saves podcasts to the directory defined there (by default
~/Podcasts/) The other mode supports just getting thrown into a directory where
BashPodder used to be and replacing it automagically, or having its config
files in the same directory as itself and then just being run from a random
location and detecting and performing a chdir correctly.  This, along with
being able to run in silent mode by simply adding -s or changing the
corresponding option in the configuration file makes GoldenPod both
cron-friendly and user-friendly.

Information on how to configure goldenpod can be found in the manpage. If
GoldenPod is installed globally on your system just type "man goldenpod" and
the manpage will happily pop up and tell you what you need, if not then type
either "man ./goldenpod.1" or "perldoc ./goldenpod" in the directory containing
the GoldenPod files and it'll (hopefully) pop happily up and (you guessed it)
tell you what you want to know.

Thanks for using GoldenPod and hope it's useful.
