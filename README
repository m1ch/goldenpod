GoldenPod - a podcast client in perl
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For installation instructions see the INSTALL file.

GoldenPod is a podcast client (or podcast aggregator, or podcatcher, feel free
to pick whichever name you want) written in perl. It supports reading
configuration files in ~/.goldenpod/ and then saving the podcasts to the
directory defined there (by default ~/Podcasts/). It also supports just getting
thrown into a directory where BashPodder used to be and replacing it
automagically, or having its config files in the same directory as itself and
then just being run from a random location and detecting and performing a chdir
correctly. This, along with defaulting to silent mode, makes GoldenPod both
cron-friendly and user-friendly.

Information on how to configure goldenpod can be found in the manpage. If
GoldenPod is installed globally on your system just type "man goldenpod" and
the manpage will happily pop up and tell you what you need, if not then type
"man ./goldenpod.1" in the directory containing the GoldenPod files and it'll
(hopefully) pop happily up and (you guessed it) tell you what you want to know.

Thanks for using GoldenPod and hope it's useful.
