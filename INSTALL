Installation instructions for GoldenPod
---------------------------------------

In order to install Day Planner simply run the command "make install" (without
the qutoes) in the GoldenPod directory. You can do this as your user to install
it locally for a single user, or as root to install it globally for all users.

Alternatively, if you're replacing bashpodder with goldenpod, simply drop the
goldenpod file into the directory where you used to have bashpodder and run it
like you used to run bashpodder.
